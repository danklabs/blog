<span style="color:black;">Memes are inside jokes that you share with strangers but finding them takes a lot of time on existing platforms, you have to go out and find a creater who posts stuff that you like and follow him and then hope he posts regularly and you have keep repeating this.</span>

> <span style="color:#75874e;">MehMeh removes all of that, you just start using the app and the state of the art recommendation system does all that work for you and finds the best memes for you.</span>
